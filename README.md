# csgo skinchanger
This is a very basic internal csgo skinchanger. It does not include any patternscans yet therefore you have to manually update the offsets. It also does not include a manual map injector yet. You can use AlisaAlis's [Manual Map DLL Injector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/209939-alisaalis-manual-map-dll-injector-x86-x64.html) from UnKnoWnCheaTs.

You can adjust the skinlayout in the `skins.cpp` file.

**Although it's very unlikely to happen you can get banned by using this cheat. So Use it at your own risk!!!**
