# csgo skinchanger
This is an very basic internal csgo skinchanger. It does not include any patternscans yet therefore you have to manually update the offsets. It also does not include an manual map injector yet. You can use AlisaAlis's [Manual Map DLL Injector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/209939-alisaalis-manual-map-dll-injector-x86-x64.html) from UnKnoWnCheaTs.

You can adjust the skinlayout in the `skins.cpp` file.
